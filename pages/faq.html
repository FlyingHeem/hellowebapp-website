        What level of programming experience do I need? What about HTML and CSS?
        </dt>
        <dd>
        <strong>Hello Web App assumes you have no previous programming knowledge.</strong> But it's best if you know a bit about HTML markup — since the book starts out building a website and setting up static files, things will fit a lot faster if you know a bit about website creation. That said, if you like to learn-by-doing, feel free to walk through the tutorial verbatim and you'll learn some HTML as you go.

        What do you build in the tutorial?
        </dt>
        <dd>
        <strong>We're building a "collection of things."</strong> That sounds generic, but you can alter the generic examples ("Thing") to something that fits this metric (like building a directory of web designers, so your "Thing" will be a "Profile.") A lot of different ideas fit this — for example, Twitter is a collection of small paragraphs. Pinterest is a collection of photos. Facebook used to be a collection of personal data.

I highly encourage you to build something unique to you, because what you'll learn will stick better!

    What version of Python and Django is Hello Web App written for?
    </dt>
    <dd>
    <strong>Hello Web App is written with Python 2.7 and Django 1.8.</strong> The book is basically Python 3 ready, but since a ton of resources (like plugins) are still on Python 2.7, I feel that beginner content should teach 2.7 so most resources are accessible. That said, I might release an additional Python 3 version in addition to the main book if demand is high enough.
