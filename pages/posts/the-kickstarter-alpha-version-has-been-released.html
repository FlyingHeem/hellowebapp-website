The Kickstarter alpha version PDF of Hello Web App has been released! If you're a backer ($10 and above), check your email for a Kickstarter update with the link.

There are still some minor things wrong (screenshots need to be retaken, code snippets need some more styling, might be typos/issues still) but overall â€” 95% done. It's quite exciting.

Now to finish up the ebook and print versions!
