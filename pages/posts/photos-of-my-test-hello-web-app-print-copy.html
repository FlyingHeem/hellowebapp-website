I've ordered one print copy of the Kickstarter Alpha so I can see how the design translates to print, as well as start updating some of the Hello Web App marketing (see the [homepage of Hello Web App](http://hellowebapp.com/) and the [HWA Twitter](http://twitter.com/hellowebapp).)

Already I can see some updates I need to make (for example, the inside edge of the content is too close to the spine, making the perfect-bound book harder to read.) However, that didn't stop me from having a mini-photoshoot in the yard. Enjoy this mini preview of the print book!

Oh, sidenote: A lot of people are asking about buying the book (which is pretty exciting.) I am working on a bunch of updates: collecting feedback from the alpha Kickstarter release, creating illustrations, and a bunch of other things that I'll go over in a future blog post. Will announce pre-orders and the launch date soon!
