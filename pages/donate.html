    <p>Missed the Kickstarters and want to donate? Perhaps you acquired the book for free and want to give back? 
        (I'm not judging!)</p>

    <p>Contributions go towards supporting the author as well as helping fund workshops and classes
        using Hello Web App's material. I appreciate it!</p>
